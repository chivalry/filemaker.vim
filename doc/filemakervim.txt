Introduction ~

filemaker.vim provides syntax highlighting and snippet support for FileMaker
calculations to be edited in Vim. It detects the filetype for the extensions
'filemaker', 'fmcalc', 'fm', and 'fmfn'. It also recognizes calculations that
have been opened using the QuickCursor app on OS X.

The following features are supported:

- Syntax highlighting of the following:
- Local and global variables
- FileMaker operators (i.e., '+', '-', '&', etc.)
- String and number literals
- Built-in FileMaker functions
- Built-in FileMaker constants (such as Get function parameters)
- Block and in-line comments
- Calculation variables that begin with an underscore or tilde (i.e., '_foo'
  or '~bar')
- Custom functions that begin with a prepended code and dot (i.e.,
  'code.CustomFunction')
- With the installation of UltiSnips, intelligent snippet insertion for all
  of the built-in FileMaker functions

Requirements ~

Currently there are two main feature sets included with filemaker.vim: syntax
highlighting and snippets. Syntax highlighting has no additional requirements.
filemaker.vim has been tested with MavVim snapshot 74 (which runs Vim 7.4) and
command-line Vim 7.4 running within a terminal on Mac OS X. It will probably
work with Vim 7 or above on any platform Vim supports, but no testing of this
has been performed yet.

                                                                *fmv-ultisnips*
UltiSnips ~

UltiSnips is a snippet system required by the snippets feature from TextMate
(https://macromates.com). Using the snippets feature requires UltiSnips
(https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips). See the the instructions below for
additional details.

                                                     *filemakervim-quickcursor*
                                                              *fmv-quickcursor*
QuickCursor ~

QuickCursor is in no way required for using filemaker.vim, but if you're using
a Mac and you have a version of it, it can make life much easier by allowing
you to press a key combination and open a FileMaker calculation directly in
MacVim.

QuickCursor is no longer being actively sold because of incompatibility with
Apple's sandboxing. There are two options available. Jesse Grosjean
(http://www.hogbaysoftware.com), the author of QuickCursor has made
the source code of version 2 available on GitHub
(https://github.com/jessegrosjean/quickcursor). Although it appears to run
under OS X Yosemite, however, it doesn't appear to be functional. Fortunately
he's also given permission for us to make version 1 available for anyone to
download. You can download a zip archive of it from DropBox
(https://www.dropbox.com/s/flkam037ia2pblm/QuickCursor.app.zip).

Alternatively, if you're interested in a workaround, check out what some
others have done by replacing QuickCursor with custom-built
(http://rocketink.net/2013/05/quickcursor-keyboard-maestro.html) rountes using
Keyboard Maestro (http://www.keyboardmaestro.com).

If neither of these solutions work for you, there are two final options we can
recommend. If you place the following line at the end of your calcuatation
before you copy and paste it into a Vim buffer, Vim will read it to set the
filetype:

// vim:ft=fmcalc

Alternative you can enter the following command while in normal mode to
manually set the file type:
>
  :set ft=fmcalc
<

Acknowledgments ~

A great deal of assistance with the snippets was kindly provided by Holger Rapp
(https://github.com/SirVer), whose help made the included snippets much more
concise and useful.

Thanks to all of the very helpful people on the #vim and #python IRC channels
at freenode.net, especially gfixler, udioica, japh, Raimondi, pgdouyon, fow,
jamessan, and watabou on #vim and Moonlightning and Avaris on #python.

Peter Odding (https://github.com/xolox) made things much easier by publishing
his vim-tools software (https://github.com/xolox/vim-tools), allowing the
plugin help files to be written almost entirely in Markdown.

                                                         *filemakervim-install*
                                                                  *fmv-install*
Installation ~

If you're already familiar with using Vundle
(https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) to manage plugins in Vim, just add
these three lines to your '.vimrc' file between the calls to 'vundle#begin'
and 'vundle#end'.
>
  Plugin 'SirVer/ultisnips'
  Plugin 'honza/vim-snippets'
  Plugin 'chivalry/filemaker.vim'
<
Then enter the ':PluginInstall' command while in normal mode in Vim.

If you need a bit more granular instructions, keep reading.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *filemakervim-vundle-install*
                                                           *fmv-vundle-install*
Vundle Installation ~

Vundle is the recommended method for installing filemaker.vim. Either read the
complete installation instructions
(https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim/blob/master/README.md#quick-start) or
follow these steps:

1. Create a '.vim' directory in your home folder if it doesn't already
   exist.

2. Create a 'bundle' directory in the '.vim' directory.

3. Run the following command from your terminal application:
>
   git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
<
4. Create a '.vimrc' file in your home directory and add the following lines
   to it:
>
   set runtimepath+=~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
   call vundle#begin()
   Plugin 'gmarik/Vundle.vim'
   call vundle#end()
   filetype plugin indent on
<
5. Quit Vim if it's already running and relaunch it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                               *filemakervim-ultisnips-install*
                                                        *fmv-ultisnips-install*
UltiSnips Installation ~

Now that Vundle is installed, installing UltiSnips is trivial. In your '.vimrc'
file, after the first call to 'Plugin', add the following lines:
>
  Plugin 'SirVer/ultisnips'
  Plugin 'honza/vim-snippets'
<
Save your '.vimrc' and run the ':PluginInstall' command.

The second plugin is completely optional, but will add many useful snippets for
other languages (PHP, JavaScript, etc.) as well as snippets for writting
snippets. See the UltiSnips documentation for more information.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                           *filemakervim-filemaker.vim-install*
                                                    *fmv-filemaker.vim-install*
filemaker.vim Installation ~

Installing filemaker.vim is just as easy as installing UltiSnips. Add this line
to your '.vimrc' file after your previous lines and before the call to
'vundle#end':
>
  Plugin 'chivalry/filemaker.vim'
<
Again, run the ':PluginInstall' command.

                                                                 *fmv-settings*
Settings ~

                                             *filemakervim-default-conventions*
                                                      *fmv-default-conventions*
Default Conventions ~

Conventions in FileMaker are notoriously varried. By default the snippets
included with filemaker.vim conform to very specific conventions for formatting
FileMaker calculations. These include the following:

- No space between a function name and its opening parenthesis
- A space between the opening and closing parentheses and the nearest
  parameter
- Functions with a single parameter are inserted on a single line
- Functions with multiple parameters are (generally) placed with each
  parameter on its own line

Note the word "generally" above. Some functions often take a single parameter
but can take multiple parameters, especially the Aggregate
(|fmp-aggregate-group|) functions, such as Count (|fmp-count|). These
multi-parameter functions are placed on a single line with their optional
parameters included as optional tab stops.

                                                   *fmv-overriding-conventions*
Overriding Conventions ~

Most of the conventions above can be overridden by setting global variables in
your '.vimrc' file.

                                        *filemakervim-FMVAddApaceAfterFunction*
                                                 *fmv-FMVAddSpaceAfterFunction*
g:FMVAddSpaceAfterFunction     Defaults to false (0). If set to true (1) a
                               space will appear between function names and
                               their opening parenthsis. For example, by
                               default functions are inserted with the
                               following format:
>
                                 Func( param )
<
                               By setting this variable to 1, functions will
                               be inserted with the following format:
>
                                 Func ( param )
<
                                        *filemakervim-FMVPadSpacesWithinParens*
                                                 *fmv-FMVPadSpacesWithinParens*
g:FMVPadSpacesWithinParens     Defaults to true (1). If set to false (0) there
                               will be no space between a funciton's parentheses
                               and its parameters. For example, by default
                               functions are inserted with the following format:
>
                                 Func( param )
<
                               If this variable is set to 0, functions will be
                               inserted with the following format:
>
                                 Func(param)
<
                                      *filemakervim-FMVSeparateParamsWithSpace*
                                               *fmv-FMVSeparateParamsWithSpace*
g:FMVSeparateParamsWithSpace   Defaults to false (0). If set to true (1) multi-
                               parameter functions will have all of their
                               parameters appear on the same line. For example,
                               by default multi- parameter functions are
                               inserted with the following format:
>
                                 Func(
                                   param1;
                                   param2
                                 )
<
                               If this variable is set to 1, multi-parameter
                               functions will be inserted with the following
                               format:
>
                                 Func( param1; param2 )
<
                               Note that this does not yet apply to the Let
                               (|fmv-let|) function.

                                            *filemakervim-FMVFillInGetFileName*
                                                     *fmv-FMVFillInGetFileName*
g:FMVFillInGetFileName         Defaults to true (1). If set to false (0),
                               functions that which have a 'fileName' parameter
                               will set this parameter to 'Get( FileName )'. For
                               example, such a function would have the following
                               format:
>
                                 Func( Get( FileName ) )
<
                               with the 'Get( FileName )' portion being a
                               snippet tab stop. If this variable is set to 0,
                               such a function would have the following format:
>
                                 Func( fileName )
<
                               with 'fileName' acting as the snippet's tab stop.

All of these settings are cumulative. For example, with their default values
the 'FieldBounds' snippet will insert the following:
>
  FieldBounds(
    Get( FileName );
    layoutName;
    fieldName
  )
<
Overriding all of the defaults results in the following:
>
  FieldBound (Get (FileName); layoutName; fieldName)
<

Trigger Standards ~

See |fmv-snippets| for the trigger text of every snippet.

An UltiSnips trigger is included for every built-in FileMaker function except
'Pi'. Every included function has a snippet that is the same as the function's
name (except the 'Get' (|fmv-get-group|) function parameters and 'DatabaseNames'
(|fmv-databasenames|), for which such a snippet is pretty useless). So you know
right away that the trigger for 'RightValues' (|fmv-rightvalues|) is
'rightvalues', but most functions have abbreviated but unique triggers ('ritv'
in this case). Although UltiSnips supports duplicate triggers, using them
seriously reduces the time savings, so if a function has an abbreviated
trigger, that trigger is unique. When multiple functions could have a
competing trigger, the one that is more likely to be used has received the
default trigger.

The trigges for 'Get' functions are generally 'get' followed by the letters in
the words making up the parameter, such as 'getfp' for 'Get( FilePath )'
(|fmv-filepath|), but using that technique does result in some duplicates. When
that's the case the default is attached to the more common function and a
logical letter is added to the alternative.

Finally, triggers are case-insensitive. In other words, 'getv', 'Getv', and
'GETV' are all triggers for the 'GetValue' (|fmv-getvalue|) function.

Optional Parameters ~

Many FileMaker functions include optional parameters that can be ommitted. When
parameters are all required each parameter is matched with a snippet tab stop.
When a parameter is optional, the optional parameters as a whole, including the
last semi-colon, are an enclosing tabstop.

A prime example are a few of the Aggregate (|fmv-aggregate-group|) functions
functions. The 'Average' (|fmv-average|) function for example needs at least
one parameter but could take a series of parameters. The trigger therefore
has three tabstops, one for the first parameter, one for the semi-colon and
optional sections parameter, and a third for the second parameter. Triggering
this snippet results in the following steps, where the currently active tabstop
is between pipes ('|'):
>
  Average( |field|; field )
<
Filling in the first tab stop and pressing UltiSnips' <jumptrigger> key
selects the semi-colon and the second parameter:
>
  Average( TO::field|; field| )
<
At this point pressing the delete key will remove the entire tab stop and using
UltiSnips' <jumptrigger> key will move outside the snippet. If there are
additional parameters to pass to 'Average' then pressing the <jumptrigger>
key will retain the semi-colon and move to the third tab stop, which is the
second parameter:
>
  Average( TO::field; |field| )
<
This is the method for tab stops whenever a function accepts optional
parameters.

                                                      *fmv-standard-parameters*
Standard Parameters ~

A few FileMaker functions accept only a specific set of options for their
parameters. The most common case of this is the 'Get' (|fmv-get-group|)
function, but a few of the Text Formatting (|fmv-textformatting|) functions
fall under this category.  Sometimes the parameters are constants, as is the
case with'Get`, and sometimes they're strings (GetLayoutObjectAttribute
(|fmv-getlayoutobjectattribute|) for example.

While standard parameters are case-insenstivie (i.e., within the 'Get' function
you can type 'account' to narrow the list of available options to those that
begin with 'Account'), the case won't be replaced with the option's case. In
other words, typing 'accounte' will end up with 'Get( accountextendedPrivileges
)'. FileMaker will correct this when the calculation is saved. Given the tools
being used having optional values replace entered text with appropriate
character cases isn't possible yet.

When a function only takes a set of standard parameters the snippet for that
function will allow any of the standard parameters to be filled in based on the
first few characters. For example, the 'TextStyleRemove' (|fmv-textstyleremove|)
function takes a number of styles for its second parameter. Triggering this
snippet and navigating to the second tab stop initially looks something like
this (with the current tabstop surrounded by pipes ('|')):
>
  TextStyleRemove(
    "some text";
    |(Plain|...|SmallCaps|Superscript|Subscript|...|AllStyles)|
  )
<
Typing 'Su' reduces the matching possible parameters to display the following:
>
  TextStyleRemove(
    "some text";
    Su|(perscript|bscript)|
  )
<
Only two of the options begin with 'Su', so the available options have been
reduced. Typing a third letter that matches one of the remaining choices
reduces the option to one, and using the <jumptrigger> key will move you out
of the snippet:
>
  TextStyleRemove(
    "some text";
    Subscript
  )|
<
Some functions take string options instead of constant options. When this is
the case the enclosing double-quote are an enclosing tabstop so that the entire
tabstop, including the double quotes, can be replaced, perhaps by a variable or
field name. Or, while on the tabstop that includes the double quotes you can
press the <jumptrigger> key and move to the quoted options. The following
state was arrived at by pressing 'getcatt<tab>"source Field"<jumptrigger>':
>
  GetContainerAttribute(
    "source Field";
      |"(filename|MD5|storageType|fileSize|...|all)"|
<
)

Note that the tabstop is selecting the quotes including the available options.
At this point typing can overwrite all of the available options. On the other
hand, pressing <jumptrigger> again leads to only the available options being
selected within the double quotes.
>
  GetContainerAttribute(
    "source Field";
      "|(filename|MD5|storageType|fileSize|...|all)|"
<
)

Finally, once the options without the double quotes are selected, typing a few
letters will narrow down the available options.
>
  GetContainerAttribute(
    "source Field";
    "file|(name|Size)|"
  )
<
